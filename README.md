# BTI425 Assignment 1

The purpose or objective of the assignment is to create a React app.

Read/skim all of this document before you begin work.

While you are doing the work, if a specific task is not clear, or it seems to require an unreasonable amount of time to complete, or it seems to require knowledge way beyond the content we’ve covered in the course, please don’t hesistate to contact your professor.

This document is being edited.
This notice will be removed when the edits are complete.


# Due Date

Sunday, February 10, 2019, at 11:00pm ET

Grade value: 15% of your final course grade

If you wish to submit the assignment before the due date and time, you can do that.


# Overview and purpose

As noted above, the purpose of objective of the assignment is to create a React app that has good coverage of the topics in the first five weeks of the course.

The app will use the single-entity web service that you worked on and posted to Heroku and Atlas during the first two weeks of this course.

The app will use React components to support the typical range of data service tasks (get, add, edit, delete).

Finally, the app will be deployed to a public host (another Heroku endpoint), so that you can deliver it to other devices (including, for example, your smartphone).


# Getting started

Getting started includes generating a new project, and configuring your development environment.

Use create-react-app to generate a new project, probably named assign1.

Make sure that your web service has been deployed to Heroku and Atlas, and make sure that you can interact with it correctly with Postman. This is important, because you must have confidence in the hosted app to make progress on the React app.

Set up the rest of your dev environment (terminal windows, editor, browsers and tools).


# Doing the work, initial

As noted above, the app will support the typical range of data service tasks (get, add, edit, delete). As a result, all the topics covered in weeks 3, 4, and 5 will be implemented in the app:

    Multiple components
    Routing
    Working with a web service
    Forms

In the following sub-sections, we suggest that you do the initial coding work that will prepare you to make progress on each of the detailed areas.

    As suggested above, read/skim all of this document before you begin work.


# Consistent layout

We must have a consistent and functional visual layout. Therefore, the first task is to create a layout, or a structure. You can use the guidance in the React web services intro code example (in the repo). Customize the “template” so that your name appears in the header area of the viewport.


# Components to support the app’s purpose

As suggested by the guidance in the HTML Forms patterns document and the React web services intro code example, create source code files to hold components for each of the five kinds of interactions.


# Routing

As suggested by the guidance and topic coverage, configure and test the routing feature. Make sure that each of the five (interaction) components participate in routing. The app’s navigation menu may have links for only the “list…” and “create…” choices, so test the routing by manually typing in the URLs.

    Remember to configure a “home” component and route, and a “not found” component and route.


# Doing the work, detail

More to come...

    In the following sub-sections, guidance will be given to enable you to iteratively and sucessfully complete each of the five interaction components.


# Testing your work

For this assignment, there is no required external testing capability. Therefore, rely on your browser tools for this step.


# Reminder about academic honesty

You must comply with the College’s academic honesty policy. Although you may interact and collaborate with others, you must submit your own work.

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard “SafeAssign” tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

SafeAssign compares your work with that of other current and past students, and with existing works on the web. It uses techniques that are difficult to defeat. The overall goal is to identify copied work.


# Submitting your work

    This procedure will be modified.
    We need both the Node+Express web service and the React web app.

Here’s how to submit your work, before the due date and time:

    Locate the folder that holds your project files.

    Make a copy of the folder. (You will be uploading a zipped version of the copy.)

    Inside that folder, remove (delete) the node_modules folder. Your professor does NOT need that folder.

    Still in that folder, add a new folder named “MyCode”. Copy these source code files to the “MyCode” folder:
    App.js
    TBA
    TBA
    For each of these files, change the file name extension to “txt”.

    Compress/zip the copied folder. The zip file SHOULD be about 1MB in size. If it isn’t, you haven’t followed the instructions properly.

    Login to My.Seneca. Open the course area. Click the “Assignments” link on the left-side navigator. Follow the link for this assignment. Submit/upload your zip file. The page will accept three submissions, so if you upload, then decide to fix something and upload again, you can do so.
